# AI Platform Engineering Assessment

## Task
Build an AI assistant API for a corporate training platform.

## Requirements
- Employees ask questions about industry trends
- Assistant searches and provides answers
- Can fetch detailed content when users want to dive deeper
- REST API with terminal chat interface (Python or TypeScript)
- No frontend needed
- Use any LLM API

## Steps
0. Prepare mock search data (10 Google-like results)
1. Build the REST API
2. Create terminal chat interface for testing

## Example Mock Data
```json
{
  "query": "AI applications corporate training 2025",
  "results": [
    {
      "title": "How AI Is Shaping the Future of Corporate Training in 2025",
      "url": "https://trainingindustry.com/articles/ai-future-corporate-training",
      "snippet": "Explore how artificial intelligence is revolutionizing corporate learning with personalized training paths, real-time feedback, and adaptive learning systems..."
    }
    // ... 9 more results
  ]
}
```

## Example Interaction
```
User: "What's new in AI regulations?"
Assistant: [Provides summary from search results]

User: "Tell me more about that EU policy"
Assistant: [Fetches and discusses specific content]
```
